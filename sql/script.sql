School-readiness is the key to closing the achievement gap. Approximately 20% of U.S. students a year start kindergarten behind, and most stay behind. Over the past 3 years, Role Models have helped these children prepare for kindergarten. Already, one group of our Learners finished kindergarten at grade level. What : Our growing team of 90 Role Models gives just 1 hour a week to prepare at-risk preschoolers for kindergarten. Where : Become a Role Model and serve a family in East Palo Alto or East Menlo Park. When : 1 hour a week. You choose a time that works for you (M-F, 12-6:15 PM) We only serve families in East Palo Alto and East Menlo Park. You must be at least 18 years old.
